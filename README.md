### Project robot
A robot picks up random placed parcels across the village and delivers them to their address.
We have 4 different robots:
    1.Random robot: it chooses its next lane randomly.

    2.Route robot: it has a predetermined route and it needs to cross it 2 times. First time to pick up parcels, and second time to deliver them.
